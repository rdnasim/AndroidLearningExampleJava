# Range of Integers
Write a program to list all the integers between two integers L and R (including L and R). L and R can be any integer between 1 and 100.
1≤L,R≤100

Instructions:

* We have defined the integer variables L and R for you.
* We have provided the code to get inputs for the variables.
* Print all the integers between L and R (including L and R) with space between them

```
Sample Input:
L = 5, R = 10
```
```
Sample Output:
5 6 7 8 9 10
```
