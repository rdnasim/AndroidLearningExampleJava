# Range of Integers
Write a program to add the corresponding elements of two arrays, each of size N and print the sums. N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 1≤N≤100

Instructions:

* We have defined an integer variable N for you.
* We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
* We have defined integer arrays numArray1[N], numArray2[N] and sumArray[N].
* We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
* You have to write the logic to add the array elements.
* Store the sum values in respective elements of variable sumArray[N]
* Print all the elements of sumArray with space between them
```
Sample Input:
N = 3
numArrayA = 3 9 8
numArrayB = 8 12 74
```
```
Sample Output:
11 21 82
```
